Adaptive Story

Group members:

Description:

A story that has multiple pathways to take. Each choice the player makes
contributes his ”points” which decides the path of the story.
The story will be stored in a file, with each of its paths. The algorithm would
read the file and generate a weighted graph for the story. The graph would be
traversed as the story progresses and the player makes choices. The next ’node’
of the story depends on the calculate ’points’ of the player and weights of the
edges leading outwards from the current node.
The story would be based on a pixel which has escaped into the real world,
and is trying to understand the new world around it.

Outcome:

An intellectual adaptive story game, where the choices would be input by the
user. The graph representing the pathways of the story, would be displayed on
the screen next to the story, and would allow for backtracking for the player to
explore multiple paths.
